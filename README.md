# Preside-CMS Docker image

This is a work in progress and playing around. This should eventually be split into a base image + working demo image for your Preside applications.

For now though, you can test this out by installing docker + docker compose and then:

```
docker-compose up -d
```

Then browse to http://localhost :)
